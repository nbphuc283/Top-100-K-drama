üìΩÔ∏è Just finished "The Glory" a few days ago and I must say the story was thrilling! This made me wonder, how could the South Koreans constantly make great movies like that? Using the data of **Top 100 K-Dramas of all time** from [MyDramaList](https://mydramalist.com/shows/top_korean_dramas?page=1), let's find out the secret formula to make a great K-Drama!

üí° In order to do this, I am to try and answer these questions using PostgreSQL:
1. Which actors/actresses appeared the most in these movies?
2. Which are the most popular genres among these movies?
3. Which are the most common tags among these movies?
4. Which airing schedules have the highest number of watchers & average score?
5. What is the appropriate number of episodes to achieve the highest number of watchers & average score?
6. What is the appropriate duration of each episodes to achieve the highest number of watchers & average score?
